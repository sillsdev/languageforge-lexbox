# Triage Labels

The skills speak in terms of five canonical triage roles. This file maps those roles to the actual strings used in this repo's issue tracker.

Because issues live as local markdown (see `issue-tracker.md`), a "label" is just the value of the `Status:` line near the top of an issue file — there is no external label system to reconcile with.

| Label in mattpocock/skills | Status string in our tracker | Meaning                                  |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `needs-triage`             | `needs-triage`               | Maintainer needs to evaluate this issue  |
| `needs-info`               | `needs-info`                 | Waiting on reporter for more information |
| `ready-for-agent`          | `ready-for-agent`            | Fully specified, ready for an AFK agent  |
| `ready-for-human`          | `ready-for-human`            | Requires human implementation            |
| `wontfix`                  | `wontfix`                    | Will not be actioned                     |

When a skill mentions a role (e.g. "apply the AFK-ready triage label"), write the corresponding string on the issue file's `Status:` line.

Edit the right-hand column to match whatever vocabulary you actually use.
