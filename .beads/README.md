# Beads - AI-Native Issue Tracking

Welcome to Beads! This repository uses **Beads** for issue tracking - a modern, AI-native tool designed to live directly in your codebase alongside your code.

## What is Beads?

Beads is issue tracking that lives in your repo, making it perfect for AI coding agents and developers who want their issues close to their code. No web UI required - everything works through the CLI and integrates seamlessly with git.

## Quick Start

### Essential Commands

```bash
# Create new issues
bd create "Add user authentication"

# View all issues
bd list

# View issue details
bd show <issue-id>

# Update issue status
bd update <issue-id> --status in_progress
bd update <issue-id> --status done

# Sync with git remote
bd sync

# Output workflow context for AI agents (used in Claude Code hooks)
bd prime
```

### AI Agent Integration

The `bd prime` command outputs essential Beads workflow context in AI-optimized markdown format. It's designed to be run at the start of AI coding sessions (SessionStart) and after context compaction (PreCompact) to ensure AI agents remember the bd workflow.

- **MCP mode**: When MCP server is active, outputs brief workflow reminders (~50 tokens)
- **CLI mode**: Outputs full command reference (~1-2k tokens)

This repository configures Claude Code hooks in `.claude/settings.local.json` to run `bd prime` automatically.

### Working with Issues

Issues in Beads are:
- **Git-native**: Stored in `.beads/issues.jsonl` and synced like code
- **AI-friendly**: CLI-first design works perfectly with AI coding agents
- **Branch-aware**: Issues can follow your branch workflow
- **Always in sync**: Auto-syncs with your commits
