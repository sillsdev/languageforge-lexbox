\
This is a beta version of a new dictionary building tool that is currently under development.\n\
\
The data you see here reflects the current data in the corresponding [Language Forge](https://languageforge.org/) project.\n\
\
This read-only version of the new dictionary tool is primarily for gathering early feedback on its look and feel. So, please use the [Feedback](/api/feedback) button in the top right corner of the page.\n\
\
## It can edit FieldWorks projects!\n\
\
It's true! There's already another version of the tool that you can use today to open and edit your data in FieldWorks.\n\
It's also loaded with additional features! We're calling it [FieldWorks Lite](https://lexbox.org/fw-lite).\n\
So, please download and try out the alpha version of [FieldWorks Lite](https://lexbox.org/fw-lite) as well.\n\
\
## Should I be excited?\n\
\
Yes! FieldWorks Lite will be revolutionary in multiple ways. It will be:\n\
\
- Cross-platform: it will work on Windows, Linux, Mac and eventually mobile\n\
- Usable offline: you won't need an internet connection\n\
- Collaborative: you will see any changes other users make as they work\n\
- Faster than you're used to - we're quite confident about that 😀\n\
\
Eventually, FieldWorks Lite will replace both [WeSay](https://software.sil.org/wesay/) and [Language Forge](https://languageforge.org/).\n\
\
So, please send us your [feedback](/api/feedback). We want this tool to serve you as well as possible.\n\
\
## FieldWorks Lite is not\n\
\
- A replacement for [FieldWorks](https://software.sil.org/fieldworks/)\n\
- A replacement for [Dictionary App Builder](https://software.sil.org/dictionaryappbuilder/)\n\
- A replacement for [Webonary](https://www.webonary.org/)"
