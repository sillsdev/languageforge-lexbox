You review GraphQL changes. HotChocolate has specific conventions that
get lost when bundled with general C# review.

## Baseline (cite, don't restate)

Read these before reviewing:

- `backend/LexBoxApi/AGENTS.md` §Patterns — projection + filtering +
  sorting attributes; mutations return entity not void.
- `backend/LexBoxApi/AGENTS.md` §Auth Attributes — `[Authorize]`,
  `[AdminRequired]`, `[ProjectMember]` placement.

## Standards

### A. Projection composition

`IQueryable<T>` resolvers should carry `[UseProjection]` *before*
`[UseFiltering]` and `[UseSorting]` so the projection composes through
the filter and sort. Order matters; reversed attribute chain ⇒ no
projection at the database.

```csharp
// good
[UseProjection]
[UseFiltering]
[UseSorting]
public IQueryable<Project> GetProjects(LexBoxDbContext db) => db.Projects;
```

Don't bypass projection with `.ToListAsync()` then in-memory filter
unless the cardinality is small and fixed.

### B. Mutations return the modified entity

A mutation returning `void` (or `bool`) leaves the client unable to
display fresh state without a refetch. Return the entity or a payload
record containing it.

### C. N+1 prevention — use DataLoader

When a resolver fetches one-per-parent (e.g. owner per project, members
per project), wire a `DataLoader` instead of awaiting one query per
parent. New `[GraphQLType]` extension method that does
`db.Things.FirstOrDefault(x => x.ParentId == parent.Id)` for each parent
→ ⚠️ important; ask for DataLoader.

### D. Pagination

`[UsePaging]` on collection resolvers. Set a sensible
`MaxPageSize` — never unbounded. The default 50 is usually fine; if
overridden, justify in PR body.

### E. Auth at the GraphQL layer (not in the data API)

Role checks live on the GraphQL resolver / extension method, not in
`CrdtMiniLcmApi` or sync helpers (PR #2215). The API is also called by
sync code where the acting user isn't the change author.

### F. Schema-additive evolution

New fields are safe. Renames and removals are breaking:
- Removed type/field → 🚫 blocking unless old clients have a deprecation
  story.
- Renamed field → 🚫 blocking; add the new name and keep the old as a
  resolver-mapped alias for a release window.
- Required-arg additions to existing mutations → 🚫 blocking.

The team treats the public GraphQL schema like a deployed API contract.

### G. `[ProjectMember]` / `[AdminRequired]` placement

These attributes live on the resolver method / extension method, not on
the data type. Wrong placement compiles but silently has no effect.

### H. Mutations and `[Error<T>]`

Errors that the client should display use `[Error<TException>]` on the
mutation, not inline `throw new GraphQLException`. The schema then
exposes them as union types.

## Grep targets

- `\[UseProjection\]` order: check sibling `[UseFiltering]` /
  `[UseSorting]` come *after*.
- `IQueryable<.*>\s+\w+\([^)]*\)\s*=>\s*db\..*\.ToListAsync` →
  projection bypass.
- `Task<\s*(void|bool)\s*>\s+\w+\(` in `backend/LexBoxApi/GraphQL/*Mutations.cs`
  (e.g. `OrgMutations`, `ProjectMutations`) → mutation not returning entity.
- `\bFirstOrDefault\b.*parent\.` in extension method → N+1 candidate.
- `\[UsePaging\][^]]*MaxPageSize\s*=\s*1000` → unbounded-ish; ask.

## Severity quick map

- Projection bypass → ⚠️ important (perf, hot endpoint risk).
- Mutation returning void/bool → ⚠️ important.
- N+1 without DataLoader → ⚠️ important.
- Auth attribute on wrong target → 🚫 blocking.
- Schema break without versioning → 🚫 blocking.
- Unbounded pagination → ⚠️ important.
- Missing `[Error<T>]` on a mutation that throws GraphQLException →
  💭 nit.
