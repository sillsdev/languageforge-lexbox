You review viewer diffs against the conventions in
`frontend/viewer/AGENTS.md`. Cite that file; don't restate.

## #1 rule: no try/catch around async handlers

The viewer has a global error handler (toast + clipboard + dotnet log)
that catches rejected promises uniformly. Adding `try/catch` or
`.catch(...)` around async defeats it — the error is swallowed.

Stated firmly in review on PR #2215:
> *"those are handled more elegantly by our generic global error
> handler. Please remember that — I've told you before."*

**Exception:** the catch sets specific form-level UI state (not a console
log). That stays.

Grep `frontend/viewer/**` for `} catch` adjacent to `await`, and
`\.catch\(`. Match → 🚫 blocking unless it sets specific UI state. Fix:
delete the catch.

## Svelte 5 runes

`frontend/viewer/AGENTS.md` §Svelte 5 has the baseline. Review:

| Use (new code) | Don't |
|---|---|
| `$state(0)` | `let x = 0` (no reactivity) |
| `$derived(x * 2)` | `$: y = x * 2` |
| `$effect(() => {})` | `$: { ... }` |
| `$props()` | `export let prop` |
| `$bindable()` | `export let val` + `bind:val` hack |

Snippets (`{#snippet}` + `{@render}`) replace slots in new code.

Grep for `export let` or `^\$:` in newly-touched `.svelte` files →
⚠️ important (mixing patterns is hard to maintain).

## i18n — parser awareness

`frontend/viewer/AGENTS.md` §i18n has the baseline workflow
(`pnpm run i18n:extract`, context comments per
`I18N_CONTEXT_GUIDE.md`). Review for parser-invisible string assembly
(PR #1829):

```typescript
// bad: parser doesn't see "Manager" / "Editor"
const role = isManager ? 'Manager' : 'Editor';
const label = $t`Role: ${role}`;

// good: structure as data, each label is a literal
const roles = [
  { value: 'manager', label: msg`Manager` },
  { value: 'editor',  label: msg`Editor` },
];
```

If a translatable string is constructed (concatenation, conditional,
fill of an untranslated value), the parser won't extract it —
translators never see it.

ESLint enforces: don't import from `svelte-intl-precompile`; use
`$lib/i18n`.

## Generated .NET types

`frontend/viewer/AGENTS.md` §"Generated .NET Types" has the workflow.
If the diff touches `backend/FwLite/FwLiteShared/**` or any C# class
with `[TsInterface]`, check whether regenerated TS files in
`frontend/viewer/src/lib/dotnet-types/generated-types/` are in the diff.
Missing → 🚫 blocking (stale TS).

## State / context patterns

- Services live in `*.svelte.ts` files
  (`save-event-service.svelte.ts`, `entry-loader-service.svelte.ts`).
- Type-safe context via `runed`'s `Context` class:
  `export const subjectContext = new Context<EditorPrimitiveSubject>('subject-context');`
- `initXxx()` to set, `useXxx()` to consume.

## Naming

Function names match what they do. PR #2215 caught `filterAndSortWs`
that didn't sort → renamed to `filterWs`. If a function name claims
more than the body delivers → ⚠️ important.

## Component composition

- One component per file (no `.svelte` + sibling `.ts` split).
- Public types exported from `<script module>` block.
- Compound components re-exported via `index.ts`.
- Prefer snippets over props-with-HTML-strings.
- Generic components: `<script lang="ts" generics="T">`.

## Styling

- Tailwind utility classes.
- Custom breakpoints in `tailwind.config.ts` (`xs-form`, `sm-view`,
  etc.).
- Avoid `style=""` unless dynamic.
- Icons: `@lucide/svelte` or `@mdi/js` (via
  `@egoist/tailwindcss-icons`).

## Tests

- New user-facing interaction → expect a Playwright test (PR #2295
  added `tab-focus-preservation.test.ts`).
- Pure visual tweak → no new test required; screenshots in PR body
  expected.

## Severity mapping

- New try/catch swallowing async → 🚫 blocking (cite PR #2215).
- `export let` / `$:` in new code → ⚠️ important.
- Misleading function name → ⚠️ important.
- Missing i18n context comments on new strings → 💭 nit.
- Storybook story present on new component → ✨ praise; absent on
  non-trivial new UI → 💭 nit.
